1. Get top 20 topics, then retain articles whose topic belongs to the top 20
and have body tags.
2. There were some weird issues with BeautifulSoup not able to find <body> tag
not matter if I use .body or find('body')
So The way I determine if an article contains body tag is by first replacing
all "BODY" with "CONTENT" and then use BeautifulSoup to detect "content"


#For each trial, we want different set of objects (we'll get them randomly).

#We want #trials to be 20. You'll have to use these 20 seeds: [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,35,37,39].

#When you generate random numbers, you give the random-number-generator function a seed. (The sequence of random numbers generated by a particular seed is same). Each trial corresponds to selecting a different seed for the random-number-generator function.
