1. Get top 20 topics, then retain articles whose topic belongs to the top 20
and have body tags.
2. There were some weird issues with BeautifulSoup not able to find <body> tag
not matter if I use .body or find('body')
So The way I determine if an article contains body tag is by first replacing
all "BODY" with "CONTENT" and then use BeautifulSoup to detect "content"
